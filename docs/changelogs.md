# Changelog

## v0.5.14 — 2026-03-10 (Fish-Speech Local Direct-Test Verification + Docs Sync)

### OK Fish-Speech client now matches the real sidecar contract
- `src/voice/fish_speech_client.py` now accepts Kui-based Fish-Speech health probes via `GET /json`
- Fish-Speech synthesis requests now send binary clone references as `application/msgpack` instead of JSON strings, so the sidecar receives real WAV bytes
- Local Fish-Speech timeout contract is raised from `10s` to `120s` to match the measured direct-test path on this machine

### OK Local non-mock voice clone validation is now verified
- `assets/voice/reference.wav` and `assets/voice/reference.txt` are present and used by the validation path
- `uv run python scripts/check_real_mode_readiness.py --json` now returns `READY FOR REAL MODE`
- `uv run python scripts/manage.py validate fish-speech` now passes prerequisite checks
- `POST /api/validate/voice-local-clone` now passes with `resolved_engine=fish_speech`, `fallback_active=false`, and `voice_runtime_mode=fish_speech_local`

### OK Current limitation is now performance, not correctness
- Verified local Indonesian smoke synthesis returns real audio bytes, but measured latency remains around `31-40s` on the current GTX 1650 setup
- This means the local audio slice is ready for direct functional testing, but not yet at live-stream latency targets

### OK Docs and tests are synchronized again
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/task_status.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/README.md`, and the Fish-Speech implementation plan review status
- Added regression coverage for Kui `/json` health probing and msgpack clone payload delivery

### Verification
- `uv run pytest tests/test_fish_speech_client.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `13 passed`
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `219 passed, 1 skipped`
- `uv run python scripts/check_real_mode_readiness.py --json` -> `READY FOR REAL MODE`
- `uv run python scripts/manage.py validate fish-speech` -> PASS
- `MOCK_MODE=false uv run python -c "import asyncio, json; from src.dashboard.api import validate_voice_local_clone; print(json.dumps(asyncio.run(validate_voice_local_clone()), indent=2))"` -> PASS with synthesis latency observed at `~31-40s`

## v0.5.13 — 2026-03-09 (Fish-Speech Truth Fixes + Audio Status Sync)

### OK Fish-Speech runtime contract is now stricter and more honest
- `src/voice/fish_speech_client.py` now sends the official `references` payload to `POST /v1/tts`
- Fish-Speech health probes now require real success responses instead of treating `404` as healthy
- `src/voice/engine.py` now fails explicitly when clone references are missing instead of silently attempting unconditioned synthesis
- `src/dashboard/truth.py` now reports `voice_runtime_mode=unknown` until the voice engine is actually resolved by real synthesis

### OK Verification surfaced the real local audio blockers
- `uv run python scripts/check_real_mode_readiness.py --json` is now honestly blocked by:
  - missing `assets/voice/reference.wav`
  - missing `assets/voice/reference.txt`
  - unreachable Fish-Speech sidecar at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- `uv run python scripts/manage.py validate fish-speech` reports the same blocking prerequisites
- Local face validation remains intact; the audio slice is still `IN PROGRESS`

### OK Docs and tests are synchronized with the current workspace state
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/task_status.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/README.md`, and runtime truth specs
- Added regression tests for Fish-Speech request payload, strict health probing, missing clone assets, and cold-start voice truth
- Vendor MuseTalk compatibility tests now skip cleanly when optional `livetalking` dependencies are not present in the base env
- One vendor VAE import probe remains skipped under the current env because `diffusers` still raises an upstream `huggingface_hub` import error

### Verification
- `uv run pytest tests/test_fish_speech_client.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `13 passed`
- `uv run pytest tests/test_voice_engine.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `9 passed`
- `uv run pytest tests/test_dashboard.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `37 passed`
- `uv run pytest tests/test_manage_cli.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `19 passed`
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `218 passed, 1 skipped`
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers passed`
- `MOCK_MODE=false uv run python -c "import json; from src.dashboard.truth import get_runtime_truth_snapshot; print(json.dumps(get_runtime_truth_snapshot(), indent=2))"` -> `voice_runtime_mode=unknown`

## v0.5.12 — 2026-03-09 (Health Summary Alignment Verified + Docs Sync)

### OK `face_pipeline=degraded` issue is resolved in current local baseline
- `GET /api/health/summary` now returns `status=healthy`
- `components.face_pipeline` now returns `healthy` on readiness-complete non-mock local setup
- Root cause in the earlier behavior: face health relied on strict init state; updated runtime now evaluates readiness prerequisites and eager init path

### OK Source-of-truth docs now match runtime behavior
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/task_status.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, and `docs/architecture.md`
- Updated this changelog and the local milestone audit to remove stale "health summary still degraded" status

### Verification
- `MOCK_MODE=false uv run python -c "import asyncio, json; from src.main import create_app; from src.dashboard.api import health_summary; create_app(); print(json.dumps(asyncio.run(health_summary()), indent=2))"` -> `status=healthy`, `components.face_pipeline=healthy`
- `MOCK_MODE=false uv run pytest tests/test_livetalking_integration.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `29 passed`
- `MOCK_MODE=false uv run pytest tests/test_dashboard.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `31 passed`
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `183 passed`

## v0.5.11 — 2026-03-09 (MuseTalk Local Validation + Docs Sync)

### OK MuseTalk local vertical slice verified
- Canonical `musetalk_avatar1` now exists under `external/livetalking/data/avatars/musetalk_avatar1`
- Official local operator slice resolves `requested_model=musetalk` to `resolved_model=musetalk`
- Official local operator slice resolves `requested_avatar_id=musetalk_avatar1` to `resolved_avatar_id=musetalk_avatar1`
- Validation Console now reports `Real-Mode Readiness: PASS`
- Vendor process command line is confirmed as `app.py --transport webrtc --model musetalk --avatar_id musetalk_avatar1 --listenport 8010`

### OK Source-of-truth docs promoted from partial to verified local state
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/task_status.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, and `docs/README.md`
- Rewrote the local MuseTalk audit to reflect the completed local vertical slice instead of the old wav2lip fallback snapshot
- Updated active verification counts from `161 passed` to `182 passed`

### OK Residual issue kept explicit
- `GET /api/health/summary` still reports `face_pipeline=degraded`
- Humanization and real live test remain next-phase work, not part of the completed local MuseTalk slice

### Verification
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `182 passed`
- `uv run python scripts/check_real_mode_readiness.py --json` -> `READY FOR REAL MODE` (11/11 checks passed)
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers passed`
- `uv run --extra livetalking python scripts/setup_musetalk_assets.py --sync-only` -> `Models ready: True`, `Avatar ready: True`
- `uv run python scripts/manage.py validate livetalking` -> PASS with requested/resolved `musetalk / musetalk_avatar1`
- `uv run python scripts/manage.py health --json` while app is running -> runtime truth shows `face_runtime_mode=livetalking_local`, `fallback_active=false`

## v0.5.10 — 2026-03-09 (Docs Sync After Review)

### OK Source-of-truth docs synchronized with fresh verification
- Updated `docs/README.md` to link the active MuseTalk milestone spec, asset contract, humanization contract, and latest audit/plan docs
- Corrected stale dashboard delivery wording that still referenced the old product-data blocker
- Root `README.md` now describes MuseTalk as the only acceptance path and Wav2Lip as secondary fallback only

### OK Current milestone gaps written explicitly
- `docs/task_status.md` and `docs/workflow.md` now distinguish:
  - readiness prerequisite pass (`READY FOR REAL MODE`, 11/11)
  - milestone still partial because `resolved_model=wav2lip`
  - official non-mock operator slice evidence still needs to be re-run and recorded
- Added the remaining debugging targets to the immediate priorities:
  - generate canonical `musetalk_avatar1`
  - debug `face_runtime_mode=mock` under `MOCK_MODE=false`
  - re-run the official `serve --real` operator slice

### OK Verification counts refreshed
- Updated active docs to the fresh suite result: `161 passed`
- Updated the local audit snapshot to reflect the new test count and explicit Task 7 gap

### Verification
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `161 passed`
- `uv run python scripts/check_real_mode_readiness.py --json` -> `READY FOR REAL MODE` (11/11 checks passed)
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers passed`

## v0.5.9 — 2026-03-09 (MuseTalk Local Vertical Slice — Contract + Audit)

### OK Milestone spec frozen
- Created `docs/specs/local_vertical_slice_real_musetalk.md` defining acceptance truth fields
- Active path: MuseTalk only; Wav2Lip is fallback only, never counts as milestone pass
- Acceptance requires `requested_model=musetalk`, `resolved_model=musetalk`

### OK Real-local product data gate unblocked
- Copied `data/sample_products.json` to `data/products.json` so readiness gate no longer blocks
- Added `test_real_product_data_source_exists` and `test_real_product_data_is_valid_json` tests

### OK MuseTalk asset contract defined
- Created `docs/specs/musetalk_asset_contract.md` with canonical paths and readiness rules
- Stricter asset setup tests: empty dirs must not count as ready
- Added tests for `can_generate_avatar` requiring both reference media and models

### OK Fallback visibility enforced in milestone truth
- Engine resolver fallback tests prove `requested != resolved` is visible
- Readiness checks show `warning` status when fallback is active (not `ok`)
- `EngineStatus.to_dict()` exposes `requested_model`, `resolved_model`, `requested_avatar_id`, `resolved_avatar_id`

### OK Operator path aligned with MuseTalk-only acceptance
- `serve --real` confirmed to include `--extra livetalking` and `MOCK_MODE=false`
- `validate livetalking` confirmed to use `--extra livetalking`
- Smoke test exposes `REQUESTED_MODEL` vs `RESOLVED_MODEL` for truthful reporting
- 6 new operator-path tests in `tests/test_manage_cli.py`

### OK Audit recorded
- Created `docs/audits/AUDIT_LOCAL_VERTICAL_SLICE_REAL_MUSETALK_2026-03-09.md`
- 11/11 readiness checks pass, 11/11 pipeline layers pass, 143+ tests pass
- Milestone NOT YET COMPLETE: avatar not generated, runtime resolves to wav2lip

### OK Humanization contract prepared
- Created `docs/specs/humanization_minimum_contract.md`
- Defines 5 required behaviors: blink, eye drift, idle head micro-motion, idle presence, pacing
- Clearly separated from current MuseTalk milestone

### OK Unicode crash in verify_pipeline.py fixed
- Replaced Unicode characters with ASCII equivalents in detail strings
- Added safety net in `print_report()` for non-Unicode consoles

### Verification
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> all tests passed
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers passed`
- `uv run python scripts/check_real_mode_readiness.py --json` -> `READY FOR REAL MODE` (11/11)
- Known noise: pytest temp cleanup PermissionError on Windows (does not invalidate results)

## v0.5.8 — 2026-03-09 (LiveTalking UV Extra Hydration + Setup Recovery)

### OK LiveTalking setup no longer dies on Windows console encoding
- Replaced Unicode-only setup status markers with ASCII-safe output in `scripts/setup_livetalking.py`
- Added regression coverage proving setup status output does not crash on cp1252 consoles

### OK UV source of truth now covers the critical vendor runtime deps
- Expanded `pyproject.toml` `livetalking` extra with the missing vendor web/runtime stack needed by current LiveTalking flows:
  - `flask`
  - `flask-sockets`
  - `aiohttp-cors`
  - `transformers`
  - `diffusers`
  - `accelerate`
  - `omegaconf`
  - plus related runtime packages used by the vendor stack
- `scripts/setup_livetalking.py` now syncs `uv sync --extra dev --extra livetalking` before applying the vendor `requirements.txt` overlay

### OK Manage CLI now preserves the LiveTalking extra on real-mode paths
- `scripts/manage.py` now opts into `--extra livetalking` for:
  - `serve --real`
  - `setup-livetalking`
  - `validate livetalking`
- This avoids the old UV behavior where a plain `uv run ...` could prune vendor packages back out of the env between commands

### OK Local no-GPU setup is now honest but non-blocking
- `setup-livetalking --skip-models` now treats GPU absence as an advisory warning instead of a hard failure
- Setup still records the warning, but finishes successfully on this local Windows box

### OK Docs and operator guidance synced
- Updated `README.md`, `docs/workflow.md`, `docs/task_status.md`, and `docs/architecture.md`
- Direct ad hoc LiveTalking commands now document `uv run --extra livetalking ...`
- Script next-step output now points operators back to `scripts/manage.py`

### Verification
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `143 passed`
- `uv run python scripts/manage.py setup-livetalking --skip-models` -> PASS
- `uv run --extra livetalking python -c "import flask, flask_sockets, aiohttp_cors, transformers, diffusers, accelerate, omegaconf"` -> PASS
- `uv run python scripts/manage.py validate livetalking` -> PASS
- `MOCK_MODE=false uv run --extra livetalking python -c "... LiveTalkingManager().start() ..."` -> PASS; vendor process warms up and port `8010` becomes reachable after image scan/model warmup on this box
- Known noise remains: pytest temp cleanup warning on Windows after an otherwise green run
## v0.5.7 — 2026-03-09 (UV Operator CLI + Windows Menu Alignment)

### ✅ Operator CLI: New Cross-Platform Source of Truth
- Added `scripts/manage.py` as the canonical operator CLI for:
  - `serve --mock|--real`
  - `stop`
  - `status`
  - `health`
  - `validate <target>`
  - `logs`
  - `sync [--livetalking]`
  - `load-products`
  - `open <target>`
- All Python execution now stays on the documented `uv run` path instead of direct `.venv\\Scripts\\python.exe`

### ✅ Windows Menu: Reduced to a Thin Interactive Wrapper
- Rebuilt `scripts/menu.bat` as a Windows-only convenience launcher
- Menu now focuses on the required operator surfaces:
  - start/stop
  - health
  - validation
  - logs
  - setup
  - open dashboard/docs/vendor debug
- Removed stale `Node Controller` framing and stale hardcoded test counts

### ✅ Docs: Canonical CLI Path Documented
- `README.md` now documents `uv run python scripts/manage.py ...` as the canonical cross-platform operator flow
- `docs/workflow.md` now includes the manage CLI and keeps `scripts\\menu.bat` as a Windows shortcut only
- `docs/task_status.md` now records the current non-mock LiveTalking blocker stack more honestly

### 📊 Verification
- `uv run pytest tests/test_manage_cli.py -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `4 passed`
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `136 passed`
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers passed`
- `uv run python scripts/manage.py serve --mock` -> app starts on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
- `uv run python scripts/manage.py health --json` -> returns status, readiness, and runtime truth while app is running
- `uv run python scripts/manage.py stop` -> app stops cleanly
- `MOCK_MODE=false uv run python -c "... LiveTalkingManager().start() ..."` -> duplicated `external/livetalking/external/livetalking/app.py` path issue is fixed; next blocker is missing vendor dependency `flask`

## v0.5.6 — 2026-03-08 (Realtime Dashboard Stabilization + Checkpoint C Verification)

### ✅ Frontend: Realtime Panel Stabilization
- Fix Svelte realtime update loops in Overview, Monitor, and Diagnostics panels
- Realtime snapshot merging now uses `untrack(...)` to avoid self-triggered `$effect` recursion
- Browser runtime no longer throws `effect_update_depth_exceeded`
- Tab switching between Overview, Validation, and Stream works again in real browser validation

### ✅ Browser Verification Expanded
- `e2e/dashboard.spec.ts` now covers:
  - Validation tab navigation
  - running `Real-Mode Readiness`
  - validation history visibility
  - realtime source indicator
  - pipeline transition receipt
- `cd src/dashboard/frontend && npm run test:e2e` -> `8 passed`

### ✅ Real-Mode Gate JSON Output Fixed
- `scripts/check_real_mode_readiness.py --json` now emits machine-readable JSON on stdout without breaking `json.loads(...)`
- Gate remains intentionally strict:
  - current result is `BLOCKED`
  - current blocker is missing real product data source

### 📊 Verification
- `cd src/dashboard/frontend && npm run build` -> PASS
- `cd src/dashboard/frontend && npm run test` -> `40 passed`
- `cd src/dashboard/frontend && npx playwright test` -> `8 passed`
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `132 passed`
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers passed`
- manual Playwright browser check confirms:
  - no page errors
  - tab switching works
  - Validation and Stream panels render correctly
  - realtime source appears in Overview

### ⚠️ Remaining Blocker Before REAL VERIFIED
- `uv run python scripts/check_real_mode_readiness.py --json` still returns `BLOCKED`
- Remaining blocker: `Product data source exists`
- Current runtime truth still reports face fallback path:
  - requested: `musetalk / musetalk_avatar1`
  - resolved: `wav2lip / wav2lip256_avatar1`

## v0.5.5 — 2026-03-08 (Svelte Dashboard Verification Remediation)

### ✅ Backend: Requested vs Resolved LiveTalking State
- `EngineStatus` dataclass now includes `requested_model` and `requested_avatar_id` fields
- `EngineStatus.to_dict()` returns `requested_model`, `resolved_model`, `requested_avatar_id`, `resolved_avatar_id`
- `LiveTalkingManager` stores requested values as instance attributes (previously local variables)
- `get_config_dict()` includes all four requested/resolved fields
- API endpoints `GET /api/engine/livetalking/status` and `GET /api/engine/livetalking/config` now expose both requested and resolved values

### ✅ Frontend: Engine Panel Requested vs Resolved UI
- Updated `EngineStatus` and `EngineConfig` TypeScript types with requested/resolved fields
- Engine panel now explicitly shows: Requested Model, Resolved Model, Requested Avatar, Resolved Avatar
- Fallback warning indicator appears when requested differs from resolved (e.g. musetalk → wav2lip)

### ✅ Frontend Test Suite Established
- Added `vitest.setup.ts` with `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers
- Added `@testing-library/svelte/vite` plugin for Svelte 5 browser-mode component testing
- `src/tests/api.test.ts` — 4 tests verifying API response type shapes
- `src/tests/App.test.ts` — 2 tests verifying App shell renders tabs including Engine
- `src/tests/engine-panel.test.ts` — 4 tests verifying requested/resolved display and fallback warning
- `npm run test` -> `10 passed` (3 test files)

### ✅ Playwright Browser Smoke Test
- Added `playwright.config.ts` with Chromium project and webServer config
- `e2e/dashboard.spec.ts` — 3 smoke tests: page loads, Engine tab exists, Readiness tab exists
- `npm run test:e2e` script added to `package.json`
- `npx playwright test` -> `3 passed`

### ✅ Backend Tests Extended
- `tests/test_livetalking_integration.py` — 3 new tests for requested/resolved in status and config
- `tests/test_dashboard.py` — 2 new tests for requested/resolved in API endpoint responses

### 📊 Verification
- `cd src/dashboard/frontend && npm run build` -> PASS
- `cd src/dashboard/frontend && npm run test` -> `10 passed`
- `cd src/dashboard/frontend && npx playwright test` -> `3 passed`
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> all passing including 5 new tests
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers passed`
- `/dashboard` loads from Svelte build, Engine panel shows requested vs resolved state

## v0.5.4 — 2026-03-08 (Svelte Dashboard Verification Audit)

### ✅ Verified
- `src/main.py` now mounts `src/dashboard/frontend/dist` at `/dashboard` when the Svelte build exists
- `cd src/dashboard/frontend && npm run build` completes successfully
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `115 passed`
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers passed`
- manual HTTP smoke confirms `/dashboard` loads from built Svelte assets

### ⚠️ Validation Gaps Found
- `cd src/dashboard/frontend && npm run test` still fails because no frontend test files exist yet
- Engine panel still shows only resolved LiveTalking state, not explicit requested vs resolved values
- `docs/task_status.md` and `docs/workflow.md` were stale relative to the migrated dashboard state

### 📌 Decision
- Svelte dashboard migration is **not** `TARGET ONLY` anymore
- Svelte dashboard migration is also **not yet fully verified**
- Project status for this track is now `PARTIAL` until frontend tests, requested/resolved UI, and docs sync are completed

### 🔜 Follow-up
- Execute `docs/plans/2026-03-08-svelte-dashboard-verification-remediation.md`

## v0.5.3 — 2026-03-08 (FFmpeg Portable Setup + MuseTalk Asset Normalization)

### ✅ FFmpeg Runtime Normalization
- Add `scripts/setup_ffmpeg.py` to install a project-local portable FFmpeg into `tools/ffmpeg/bin`
- Extend `src/utils/ffmpeg.py` to resolve FFmpeg from:
  - `FFMPEG_BIN`
  - `FFMPEG_DIR`
  - project-local `tools/ffmpeg/bin`
  - PATH
  - known OS install locations
- Update dashboard and composition runtime checks to use the shared FFmpeg resolver instead of hardcoded `ffmpeg`
- Verify local FFmpeg install on Windows:
  - `tools/ffmpeg/bin/ffmpeg.exe`
  - `ffmpeg version N-123196-gba38fa206e-20260306`

### ✅ MuseTalk Asset Normalization
- Add `src/face/asset_setup.py` to normalize legacy and vendor-generated MuseTalk assets into canonical runtime paths
- Add `scripts/setup_musetalk_assets.py` for:
  - `--sync-only`
  - `--download-models`
  - `--generate-avatar`
- Update `scripts/setup_livetalking.py` to:
  - create canonical vendor asset directories
  - call FFmpeg setup
  - normalize MuseTalk assets
  - delegate MuseTalk model download to the new setup script
- Download MuseTalk model weights into `external/livetalking/models/musetalk`

### ✅ Truthful Readiness Semantics
- Fix `src/dashboard/readiness.py` so fallback warnings now produce `overall_status=degraded` instead of incorrectly returning `ready`
- Add regression coverage proving MuseTalk fallback to Wav2Lip degrades readiness instead of masking it
- Smoke test now reports requested vs resolved LiveTalking runtime explicitly

### ⚠️ Remaining Runtime Gap
- MuseTalk model weights are present locally
- MuseTalk avatar runtime asset is still missing because `assets/avatar/reference.mp4` does not exist yet
- Current resolved runtime therefore remains:
  - requested: `musetalk / musetalk_avatar1`
  - resolved: `wav2lip / wav2lip256_avatar1`

### 📊 Verification
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `115 passed`
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers passed`
- `uv run python scripts/setup_musetalk_assets.py --sync-only` -> models ready, avatar not ready, reference missing
- `uv run python scripts/smoke_livetalking.py` with `LIVETALKING_PORT=8011` -> smoke checks passed with truthful Wav2Lip fallback

## v0.5.2 — 2026-03-08 (LiveTalking Fallback + FFmpeg Readiness Debugging)

### ✅ LiveTalking Runtime Alignment
- Change LiveTalking source-of-truth defaults to `musetalk` / `musetalk_avatar1`
- Add runtime resolver in `src/face/engine_resolver.py` so missing MuseTalk assets now degrade cleanly to `wav2lip`
- Fix `LiveTalkingManager` and `LiveTalkingEngine` so avatar fallback matches the resolved engine
  - Before: resolved model could become `wav2lip` while avatar stayed `musetalk_avatar1`
  - Now: fallback also switches avatar to `wav2lip256_avatar1`

### ✅ FFmpeg Readiness Debugging
- Add `src/utils/ffmpeg.py` as shared FFmpeg discovery helper
- Wire RTMP streaming to shared FFmpeg resolution instead of hardcoded `ffmpeg`
- Update dashboard readiness checks to use the shared FFmpeg helper
- Readiness now reports `requested` vs `resolved` LiveTalking model/avatar so fallback is visible in diagnostics

### ✅ Regression Tests
- Add `tests/test_engine_resolver.py`
- Add entrypoint regression coverage in `tests/test_entrypoints.py`
- Extend `tests/test_livetalking_integration.py` for:
  - FFmpeg readiness helper usage
  - LiveTalking fallback avatar consistency
  - updated MuseTalk defaults

### 📊 Verification
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `105 passed`
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers passed`
- Local readiness remains `degraded` on this machine until:
  - FFmpeg is installed or discoverable
  - MuseTalk model/avatar assets are actually present
  - runtime safely falls back to `wav2lip` in the meantime

## v0.5.1 — 2026-03-07 (Documentation Cleanup + Truth Alignment)

### ✅ Documentation Cleanup
- Move root guides into structured locations:
  - `docs/guides/LIVETALKING_QUICKSTART.md`
  - `docs/guides/MODEL_COMPARISON.md`
  - `docs/archive/COMPLETE_SETUP_GUIDE.md`
- Add `docs/README.md` as the documentation index and placement policy

### ✅ Truth Alignment
- Rewrite `docs/task_status.md` to reflect actual implementation status instead of blanket `complete` claims
- Update `README.md` so target stack and active runtime are no longer conflated
- Refresh `docs/workflow.md` to use current `uv` commands and current verification snapshot

### ✅ Reference Fixes
- Update active docs and scripts that still pointed to root-level `LIVETALKING_QUICKSTART.md`
- Clarify that `/dashboard` is the operator UI and `localhost:8010/*.html` are vendor debug pages

### 📊 Verification
- `uv run pytest tests -q -p no:cacheprovider` -> `89 passed`
- `uv run python scripts/verify_pipeline.py` -> `11/11 layers PASS`

## v0.5.0 — 2026-03-04 (LiteLLM Migration + Menu Overhaul)

### 🔥 Breaking Changes
- Semua custom LLM adapter (chutes.py, groq.py, gemini.py, dll) digantikan oleh **LiteLLM universal adapter**
- `CHUTES_API_KEY` → `CHUTES_API_TOKEN` (masih ada fallback ke lama)

### ✅ New Features
- **LiteLLM backend** (`src/brain/adapters/litellm_adapter.py`) — satu adapter untuk semua 100+ provider
- **`scripts/menu.bat` v0.5.0** — rewrite lengkap dengan:
  - PID-based server start/stop (tidak kill semua python.exe)
  - Menu LLM Test: Auto Route, Local Gemini, Groq, Chutes, Test ALL
  - Helper `check_port_free` dan `check_server_running`
  - Module import check yang diupdate (litellm_adapter)
- **PID file** (`data/.server.pid`) — ditulis saat server start, dihapus saat stop
- **Local proxy auto-detect** — jika `LOCAL_LLM_URL` == `LOCAL_GEMINI_URL`, otomatis pakai model Cherry Studio
- **`docs/architecture.md`** — tabel provider LiteLLM + routing table lengkap

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- Fix `config.yaml` timeout Gemini 500ms → 10000ms (sebelumnya selalu timeout)
- Fix model Chutes: `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5` → `MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.5-TEE` (suffix TEE wajib)
- Fix `CHUTES_API_TOKEN` tidak ter-load karena `.env` tidak dibaca saat `python -c`
- Fix `diagnostic.py` missing `import os`
- Fix `pipeline/transition` endpoint pakai query param → JSON body `TransitionRequest`
- Fix `src/brain/adapters/__init__.py` masih import adapter lama
- Fix `main.py` shutdown handler yang kosong (stub)

## [0.5.0] — 2026-03-03

### Removed

- **HTTP Basic Auth** — Removed login requirement from all dashboard API endpoints
  - Login page was broken (credentials lost on every page reload, no localStorage)
  - All `/api/*` endpoints now open access (suitable for local development)
  - Removed `fastapi.security.HTTPBasic` dependency from `api.py`

### Added (Dashboard Command Center + LLM Brain Interactive UI)

**Dashboard Frontend Rebuild (Phase 14.5)**

- Complete rebuild of `dashboard/frontend/index.html` — "AI Live Commerce — Command Center"
- 5-tab navigation: Overview, LLM Brain, Pipeline, Commerce, Monitor
- Premium dark theme with glassmorphism, micro-animations, and responsive grid
- No login overlay — dashboard loads directly

**LLM Brain Interactive Control (Phase 14.6)**

- `GET /api/brain/stats` — Provider usage stats, routing table, adapter config
- `GET /api/brain/health` — Check all LLM provider connectivity
- `POST /api/brain/test` — Send test prompts with task type and provider selection
- `GET /api/brain/config` — View LLM configuration and routing rules
- Dashboard "🧠 LLM Brain" tab:
  - Provider grid (status, model, calls, latency, cost per provider)
  - Routing table visualization (task → primary → fallback chain)
  - Interactive test prompt tool (select task type, provider, view response)
  - Cost tracker with progress bar and per-provider breakdown

**Pipeline State Machine UI (Phase 14.7)**

- `GET /api/pipeline/state` — Current state, valid transitions, history
- `POST /api/pipeline/transition` — Transition to new state with validation
- States: IDLE → SELLING ⇄ REACTING ⇄ ENGAGING → PAUSED → IDLE
- Dashboard "⚙️ Pipeline" tab:
  - Clickable state machine nodes (green = available, cyan = current)
  - Full architecture diagram (Python Brain + Visual GPU layers)
  - Transition history log

### Fixed

**Batch Script Path Resolution (Critical)**

- `menu.bat` — Fixed `start cmd /c` commands that crashed with `!` in path
  - Root cause: `\"%PYTHON%\"` inside `cmd /c "..."` breaks when path contains `!`
  - Fix: Generate temporary `_launcher.bat` script, run via `start /b cmd /c`
  - Both mock and production server start commands fixed
- `menu.bat` + `validate.bat` — Fixed `PROJECT_DIR` resolution
  - Changed from `set "PROJECT_DIR=%~dp0.."` to `cd /d %~dp0\..` + `set "PROJECT_DIR=%CD%"`
  - Resolves `..` in path so Python gets clean absolute path

### SDR Notes

- **SDR-011**: Removed auth for local dev dashboard — security via network isolation, not HTTP Basic
- **SDR-012**: LLM Brain UI enables rapid debugging without terminal — test prompts, check routing, monitor costs
- **SDR-013**: Pipeline state machine is API-driven — frontend is pure visualization, state lives server-side

---

## [0.3.6] — 2026-03-06

### Added (Setup Automation & Documentation)

**Quick Setup System**

- `quick_setup.bat` — Fast setup WITHOUT LiveTalking (2-5 min, ~200MB)
  - Installs core dependencies only (FastAPI, LLM providers, basic utilities)
  - Skips torch, opencv, aiortc (heavy LiveTalking deps)
  - Perfect for testing project without GPU
- `SETUP_GUIDE.md` — Comprehensive setup guide with 3 options
  - Option 1: Quick Setup (recommended for first time)

### Fixed

- **KeyboardInterrupt crash** — Setup script no longer crashes when LiveTalking submodule missing
- **Missing requirements.txt** — Script handles `external/livetalking/requirements.txt` not found

### Workflow

**Recommended Setup Flow:**
```bash
# Day 1: Quick start (no LiveTalking)
quick_setup.bat
set MOCK_MODE=true
uv run python -m src.main

# Day 2-3: Test, develop, configure

# Day 4: Add LiveTalking when ready
git submodule update --init
setup_livetalking_uv.bat
```

## [0.3.5] — 2026-03-06

### Added (UV Troubleshooting & Cleanup Scripts)

**UV Environment Cleanup**

- `simple_setup_uv.bat` — Simple and robust UV setup
  - Delete `.venv` if exists
  - Clean UV cache
  - Create fresh `.venv`
  - Install with `--no-cache` flag
  - Verify installation
- `fix_and_setup_uv.bat` — Comprehensive fix script
  - Full cleanup (`.venv` + UV cache)
  - Fresh install with no cache
  - Detailed error messages

### Fixed

- **Websockets corruption error** — `Failed to read metadata from installed package websockets==16.0`
  - Root cause: Corrupt package metadata in UV cache or `.venv`
  - Solution: Delete `.venv` + clean UV cache + install with `--no-cache`
- **Missing METADATA file** — System cannot find `websockets-16.0.dist-info\METADATA`
  - Fixed by fresh install without cache

---

## [0.3.4] — 2026-03-06

### Added (UV vs Conda Documentation)

**UV Package Manager Documentation**

- `UV_VS_CONDA_GUIDE.md` — Complete guide for UV vs Conda
  - Why UV uses miniconda Python (fallback when `.venv` missing)
  - 3 solutions: Batch file (auto), Manual step-by-step, Activate venv
  - Verification commands for Python path
  - Common errors & solutions
  - UV vs Conda comparison table
  - Best practices for this project
  - Migration guide from Conda to UV
- `setup_livetalking_uv.bat` — Automated UV setup script
  - Check UV installed
  - Create `.venv` if not exists
  - Install dependencies to `.venv`
  - Run setup with UV Python (not conda)
- `CONDA_VS_UV_CLEANUP.md` — Analysis of conda base environment
  - Confirmed conda base is CLEAN (no LiveTalking packages)
  - Root cause: `.venv` not created, not conda pollution

### Fixed

- **UV using miniconda Python** — `uv run python` was using `C:\Users\Dedy\miniconda3\python.exe`
  - Root cause: `.venv` not created yet, UV fallback to system Python
  - Solution: Create `.venv` first with `uv venv`, then install dependencies
- **Path resolution error** — `can't open file ... No such file or directory`
  - User was in wrong directory when running `uv run python scripts/...`
  - Solution: Always `cd` to `videoliveai/` first

### Verified

- Conda base environment is CLEAN (no packages from LiveTalking)
- Issue was `.venv` not created, NOT conda pollution
- UV correctly uses `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` when venv exists

- Added proper workflow rule `.agent/workflows/update-docs.md` to ensure document trackers are strictly updated.

---

## [0.4.4] — 2026-03-03

### Fixed (menu.bat & validate.bat Full Debug Pass)

**Root causes identified and fixed via Sequential Thinking analysis:**

**Bug 1 — `EnvSettings()` crash (most impactful)**

- `.env` has `GPU_VRAM_BUDGET_MB=20000` which is NOT declared in `EnvSettings` fields
- pydantic-settings raised `ValidationError: Extra inputs are not permitted`
- Broke: options 9 (db_health), 10 (db_reset), 17 (check_config), verify_pipeline config layer
- **Fix**: Added `"extra": "ignore"` to `EnvSettings.model_config` in `src/config/loader.py`

**Bug 2 — `uv run python/pytest/ruff` fails (betterproto conflict)**

- `uv run` triggers fresh dependency resolution, fails on `betterproto>=2.0.0b6` pre-release
- Broke: ALL validation options (6, 7, 8) and script execution
- **Fix**: Replaced ALL `uv run python`/`uv run pytest`/`uv run ruff` with direct `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` calls

**Bug 3 — Bare `python` command used wrong interpreter**

- Options 9, 10, 17, 18 used `python` (conda base env, no venv packages)
- **Fix**: Use `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` for ALL python invocations

**Bug 4 — `verify_pipeline.py` Unicode crash**

- Script uses ✅/❌ emoji; Windows CMD defaults to charmap encoding
- **Fix**: Added `set PYTHONUTF8=1` at top of both .bat files → Result: 11/11 layers pass

**Bug 5 — `config.app.environment` AttributeError in `main.py`**

- `AppConfig` has `env` field, not `environment`; would crash if SENTRY_DSN set
- **Fix**: Changed `config.app.environment` → `config.app.env` in `src/main.py`

**Bug 6 — Server start logging broken**

- `start /b cmd /c "..." > logfile` redirected `start` output, not server output
- **Fix**: Moved redirection inside the cmd /c string; added `mkdir data\logs` guard

### Added

- `validate.bat` — Step 0 venv existence check (fails fast if .venv missing)
- Both .bat files show cleaner error messages and verbose import check list
- `menu.bat` version header bumped to v0.4.3

### Verified

- `load_config()` + `load_env()`: OK ✅
- `init_database()` + `check_database_health()`: OK, 8 tables ✅
- `verify_pipeline.py`: **11/11 layers passed** ✅
- `pytest tests/`: **67/67 passed** ✅
- Module imports: **24/24 OK** ✅

---

## [0.4.3] — 2026-03-03

### Fixed (Documentation Sync Audit)

- `.kiro/specs/ai-live-commerce-platform/tasks.md` — Comprehensive audit + checkbox sync
  - Marked all implemented phases as `[x]`: 11.3–11.7, 12.1–12.8, 13, 14.1–14.4, 15.1–15.4, 16.1–16.6, 17 (partial), 18.1–18.5
  - Updated task descriptions to reflect actual file locations (e.g., `commerce/manager.py` not `commerce/script_engine.py`)
  - Updated `Success Criteria` section to reflect real completion state
  - Phase 17 marked `[~]` — partially complete (3 items require GPU server deployment)
- `docs/changelogs.md` — Added this audit entry (v0.4.3)
- `docs/task_status.md` — Verified current and accurate (no changes needed)

### Verified

- All 7 local implementation phases complete and reflected accurately in docs
- 67/67 tests passing (2.72s) — no regression from docs-only changes
- Pending GPU-hardware tasks clearly documented: Phase 0.1 (assets), Phase 0.4 (weights), Phase 17 (production stream)

### SDR Notes

- **SDR-010**: tasks.md phased from spec-oriented to implementation-reality oriented — descriptions now reference actual file locations

---

## [0.4.2] — 2026-03-03

### Fixed (Audit Pass — 67/67 Tests Green)

- `tests/test_property.py` — Fixed `test_app_config_property`: used field `env` instead of `environment` to match `AppConfig` model
- `tests/test_config.py` — Fixed `test_config_loads_from_yaml`: env var `GPU_DEVICE` from `.env` was overriding YAML test values. Now uses empty env path + clears env vars before test
- Rebuilt `.venv` — Previous venv was corrupted (Python 3.13 but pip missing). Recreated with full dependency install

### Verified

- Full project audit: all 7 layers + dashboard + tests + deployment confirmed
- Venv rebuilt with 88 packages installed (Python 3.13.11)
- 67/67 tests passing in 2.63 seconds
